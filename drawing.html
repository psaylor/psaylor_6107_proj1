			<p>Conway's Game of Life fascinated the world by showing that complex patterns could arise out of simple rules applied to seeming chaos. The game features a 2D grid of cells, each of which lives or dies based on its interaction with its neighbors as follows:
			</p>

			<ol> 
				<li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
				<li> Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
				<li> Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>
				<li> Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell in the next generation.</li>
			</ol>
