			<small>Conway's Game of Life fascinated the world by showing that complex patterns could arise out of simple rules applied to seeming chaos. The game features a 2D grid of cells, each of which lives or dies based on its interaction with its neighbors as follows:
			</small>

			<ol> 
				<li><small> Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.</small></li>
				<li><small> Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.</small></li>
				<li><small> Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</small></li>
				<li><small> Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell in the next generation.</small></li>
			</ol>

			<small>The demonstration above starts from a random initial state of live and dead cells and succesively applies the 4 rules to get each new generation. Watch as the chaos melts into order.</small>
